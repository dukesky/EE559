# Introduction
 This is the work of our  2018 spring EE559 - Pattern Recognition project. This projet was built by MATLAB. The project includes two sub-project. 
 >1. Online news popularity prediction 
 >2. Bank investiment prediction
 

# 1.Bank Investiment Prediction
> Overview:
* the dataset contains information on people targeted by a bank
marketing campaign. Your goal is to predict if a client will subscribe to a long term
deposit at a certain bank after receiving a marketing call.</p>
> Dataset:  
* [bank-additional.csv](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing#)                   </p>
> Applied Machine Learning method: 
* SVM
* Naïve Bayes
* Logistic regression
* K nearest neighbor, 
* Perceptron 
* Neural Network</p>

# 2.Online News Feed Prediction
> Overview:
* the dataset provides several attributes from different articles
published by Mashable. Your goal is to predict if an article is popular or not. The
labels (popular/ not popular) are based on the number of shares that article received.             </p>
> Dataset:
* [OnlineNewsPopularityReduced.csv](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/online+news+popularity#)                   </p>
> Applied Machine Learning method:  
* SVM
* Naïve Bayes
* Logistic regression
* K nearest neighbor, 
* Perceptron 
* Neural Network</p>
